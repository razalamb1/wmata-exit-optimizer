# WMATA Exit Optimizer

A simple web application to help users know where to board on the WMATA trains for optimized exits. The idea of the application is that the users can select a start and end station (of the 98 WMATA metro stops), and the application will provide information on where to board the trains for optimized exits.

This application owes a huge gratitude to [eable2/DCMetroStationExits](https://github.com/eable2/DCMetroStationExits). The data in [data](data) is a lightly modified version of this data.

**Note**: I am not affiliated with WMATA, just a huge fan.
